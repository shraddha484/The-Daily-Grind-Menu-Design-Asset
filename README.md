# 🌿 The Daily Grind - Cafe Menu Design Asset ☕

A complete two-panel menu design asset created for **"The Daily Grind,"** a conceptual local cafe and comfort spot. This repository holds the design files, mockups, and final exports for print.

## ✨ Project Overview

**The Daily Grind** is a concept for a cozy, community-focused cafe that specializes in high-quality coffee, fresh foods, and a comfortable atmosphere.

The menu design needed to reflect this branding:
* **Aesthetic:** Warm, rustic, inviting, and natural.
* **Function:** Clear, easy-to-read, and well-organized for both beverages and main dishes.



## 💡 Design Features and Rationale

The design choices were made to enhance the cafe's "local comfort spot" identity:

* **Color Palette:** Dominated by a soft, **creamy off-white/beige** background paired with **muted, earthy tones** (browns, deep reds, and greens) for the text and illustrations.
* **Illustrations:** Hand-drawn style **coffee bean and cherry accents** create a natural, organic border, softening the overall look and guiding the reader's eye.
* **Typography:** The use of a friendly, slightly decorative **script font** for the logo ("The Daily Grind") and a clean, highly legible **serif font** for the body text ensures both charm and practicality.
* **Layout:** A two-column, two-panel layout clearly separates **Beverages** and **Main Dishes**, improving navigation for the customer.
